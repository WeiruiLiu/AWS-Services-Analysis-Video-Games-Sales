Group Project: Yanjun Liu, Rayna Liu, Zheyue Wang

## Introduction
Video games are a billion-dollar business and have been for many years since the first games emerged in the 1970s. During the COVID-19 pandemic, gaming has become entertainment and time filling for many people. Especially, the Nintendo games, Playstation games, and PC games. As a result,  there is an increased interest in gaming and video game sales have increased due to COVID-19-related lockdown measures. In this project, we are going to analyze the sales trends from more than 16,500 popular video games.
